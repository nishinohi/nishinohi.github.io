# Concept

The windows are designed not for the convenience of the occupants or the interior space, but for the pedestrians who view the urban landscape. Residents will be able to direct their living space as part of the urban landscape by adapting to the continuously transforming louvers.  
In the compact city of Minamihorie, a new urban landscape may be created when the facade of a building with a historical background is not lost, but is made into a facade for pedestrians.

Depending on the angle of view, the louvers become openings, or conversely, they overlap each other and become like walls.  
By changing the length of the louvers, a space to be shown (public) and a space not to be seen (private) are created, creating a gradation of scenery for people walking around.
