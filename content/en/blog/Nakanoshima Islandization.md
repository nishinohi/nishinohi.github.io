# Concept

Surrounded by water and located in Osaka, Nakanoshima was a key part of the water city of Osaka, a center of trade using water transportation, and the birthplace of culture. However, with the construction of large bridges and highways, and the spread of subways, Nakanoshima has lost its context as an island, and is now perceived as just another piece of land.  
This museum is a plan to "islandify" Nakanoshima as a cradle of culture. Surrounded by water, the island will be repeatedly visited by ships that once carried water transportation, and visitors will be reminded of Nakanoshima as a special place, an island.
