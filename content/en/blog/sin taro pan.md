In 2013 (second year of graduate school), I was in charge of the renovation of a bakery called Taro Pan located at Hankyu Ishibashi Station (budget: 3 million yen). With the help of a local construction company, I was able to be deeply involved in the planning, design, and construction, and the project was completed without going over schedule.
The walls are all plastered with the help of a friend. The fixtures, tables and chairs for the eat-in space were all made by hand in cooperation with a local welder.
Below is a photo of the current state and a poster I made for this project.

We proposed about five different renovation plans and asked the client to decide on the content of the plan.
Throughout the meeting, I realized that the client was more anxious than I had thought about whether the renovation would be completed successfully. The design I had been working on was only a university project, and I experienced the important phase of convincing the client.
Unlike assignments that can be carried out without any risk, I learned once again that in order to actually build something, it is necessary to clear various problems other than design.
