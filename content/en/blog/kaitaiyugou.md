# Concept

The more family members you have, the more rooms you need, and the larger the space you need. However, as the family structure changes, the size required for a house will eventually decrease.
How will the house be able to cope with this change? A child's room that is no longer used, a slightly larger living room, an extra bedroom. By opening them up to the outside, the interior area of the house is reduced and the exterior space is expanded.
The houses will spread loosely, intertwining materials and structures in a complex way, intersecting with their surroundings and creating various boundaries.
