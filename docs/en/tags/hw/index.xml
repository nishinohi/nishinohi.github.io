      <description>What I made  Using the 3G module created previously  as a reference, I have created a compact Gateway that combines a microcontroller and an LTE module.
OSH  Products for reference First, get a schematic from OSH. In this case, I will refer to the circuit diagram of Wio LTE , which is also a SORACOM certified device and provided by Seeed. However, if you order PCBA from Seeed, it is cheaper and faster to use the parts list provided by Seeed.</description>

      <title>Creating a compact 3G module</title>

      <description>What I made  This is a 3G communication module with GPS function, and since I don&amp;rsquo;t have any knowledge about HW design, I didn&amp;rsquo;t design HW from scratch, but rather redesigned and manufactured a compact module by modifying a multifunctional 3G module provided by OSH.
Why I made it  At the time I built this (2016 or so), there were no relatively cheap modules that could use the mobile radio network.</description>
