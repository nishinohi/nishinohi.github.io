      <description>What is MATAGEEK?  In a nutshell, it is a detection and notification system for hunting traps using BLE mesh network.
Trap hunting is a tough job  Hunting is often associated with hunting rifles, but trap hunting is also an important method. However, in principle, the traps that have been set need to be patrolled every day.1 (To prevent non-hunting birds and animals from being caught, to prevent wounded animals from being created, etc.</description>

      <description>What I made  Using the 3G module created previously  as a reference, I have created a compact Gateway that combines a microcontroller and an LTE module.
OSH  Products for reference First, get a schematic from OSH. In this case, I will refer to the circuit diagram of Wio LTE , which is also a SORACOM certified device and provided by Seeed. However, if you order PCBA from Seeed, it is cheaper and faster to use the parts list provided by Seeed.</description>

      <description>What I made  This is a 3G communication module with GPS function, and since I don&amp;rsquo;t have any knowledge about HW design, I didn&amp;rsquo;t design HW from scratch, but rather redesigned and manufactured a compact module by modifying a multifunctional 3G module provided by OSH.
Why I made it  At the time I built this (2016 or so), there were no relatively cheap modules that could use the mobile radio network.</description>
