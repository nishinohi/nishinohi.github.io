      <description>Concept The windows are designed not for the convenience of the occupants or the interior space, but for the pedestrians who view the urban landscape. Residents will be able to direct their living space as part of the urban landscape by adapting to the continuously transforming louvers.
In the compact city of Minamihorie, a new urban landscape may be created when the facade of a building with a historical background is not lost, but is made into a facade for pedestrians.</description>

      <description>Concept Surrounded by water and located in Osaka, Nakanoshima was a key part of the water city of Osaka, a center of trade using water transportation, and the birthplace of culture. However, with the construction of large bridges and highways, and the spread of subways, Nakanoshima has lost its context as an island, and is now perceived as just another piece of land.
This museum is a plan to &amp;ldquo;islandify&amp;rdquo; Nakanoshima as a cradle of culture.</description>

      <description>In 2013 (second year of graduate school), I was in charge of the renovation of a bakery called Taro Pan located at Hankyu Ishibashi Station (budget: 3 million yen). With the help of a local construction company, I was able to be deeply involved in the planning, design, and construction, and the project was completed without going over schedule. The walls are all plastered with the help of a friend. The fixtures, tables and chairs for the eat-in space were all made by hand in cooperation with a local welder.</description>

      <description>Concept The more family members you have, the more rooms you need, and the larger the space you need. However, as the family structure changes, the size required for a house will eventually decrease. How will the house be able to cope with this change? A child&amp;rsquo;s room that is no longer used, a slightly larger living room, an extra bedroom. By opening them up to the outside, the interior area of the house is reduced and the exterior space is expanded.</description>
